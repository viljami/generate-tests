# Automated Unit Test Generation

This application generates automatically unit tests. It's aim is to get 100% line coverage but not 100% test coverage.

Current version only works with functions which have basic if-else structure. Anything more complex will not work. This is a proof of concept level application.

## Setup, Running and Testing

Application is based on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). Install it before proceeidng.

```bash
# Install
npm install

# Run
npm start target.js

# Test
npm test
```

##Â The purpose of tests

[TDD saves resources](https://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/so/2007/03/s3024.pdf) and:

  1. Design aid: Writing tests first gives you a clearer perspective on the ideal API design.
  2. Feature documentation (for developers): Test descriptions enshrine in code every implemented feature requirement.
  3. Test your developer understanding: Does the developer understand the problem enough to articulate in code all critical component requirements?
  4. Quality Assurance: Manual QA is error prone. In my experience, itâ€™s impossible for a developer to remember all features that need testing after making a change to refactor, add new features, or remove features.
  5. Continuous Delivery Aid: Automated QA affords the opportunity to automatically prevent broken builds from being deployed to production.

## Design Decisions

These aspects greatly affect test generation performance and results:
  1. Scoring function which directs the evolution of the genomes.
  2. Meta genes tresholds.
  3. Time allocated to mutations.
  4. Gradien descent part for amplitude change of mutations over iterations and amount of genomes to choose from.

Speeding up factors
  * Pre calculated starting set
  * Different agent programs for different type of modules

Terms
  * A genome is full set of genetic material and is formed by genes. Our full set is all the possible tests that could be generated.
  * A gene is a part of genome and defines a unit of heredity. For us a gene represents a test.
  * A nucleotide is a building block of a gene. Our tests are constructed from numbers and a nucleatide is one of those numbers.

### Scoring

Agent performance should be measured based on it's effect on the environment - not internal state. (Machine Learning - the Third Edition, Russel & Norvig 2010, page. 37)

In simple version it seems to be enought to simple follow the amount of lines getting covered. A good addition would be the amount of test cases required to get the current result. Less cases would increase the bonus.

```js
// file: src/scoring.js

function score(stats) {
  return Math.floor(stats.visited.length * 10000);
}
```

### Meta Genes

For a function to be tested there are three kinds of genes:

1. Is a gene active. If it is print the related test case. If not do not include the test in the test file.
2. Type of a parameter. Only basic types for now: uint, small int, int, double, string, bool and null.
3. The value of the previously described type.

The gene structure could be for a three parameter function:

```js
// The first is for activation.
// From the second to the last there are type and value pairs, but all the values are in one array for the sake of performance and mutation handling.

[0.5, 0.1, 0.4, 0.2, 0.9, 0.7, 0.3, ...]
```

There are double amount of possible genes than there are branches in the application. And activation value is for reducing the amount of resulting test cases to bare minimum.

```js
// file: src/data-adapter.js
// The treshod of gene activation.

const isActive = data[0] > 0.3;
```

### Amplitude change

```js
// file: src/case.js
// Per iteration step
amplitude -= 0.001;
if (amplitude < 0.1) amplitude = 0.3;
```
